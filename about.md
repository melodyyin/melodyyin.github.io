## Hi there! My name is Melody. 
 
![cheeks less chubby than they appear](/etc/itme.jpg)

I graduated from Northwestern University in June with degrees in Statistics and Computer Science. I am a data scientist based on San Francisco! Most recently, I built a [patient activity detector for hospitals](http://melodyyin.github.io/patient-activity-detection-using-kinect). In the past two years, I have worked on establishing and developing a non-profit startup that diverted ~10 tons of waste from local landfills and saved college students thousands of dollars. My previous internships include Analytics at a major airline and Equity Research at a startup investment firm. Mosey on over to [my about.me page](https://about.me/melodyyin) to learn more about past projects. 

I love reading poetry, listening to podcasts and learning what's new in the technology industry. I also enjoy creating and appreciating art in all forms!

If you want to get in touch, shoot me an email at melodyyin18@gmail.com or find me on [Yelp](http://yayhappyreviews.yelp.com/) or [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Melody-Yin-5). 

Thanks for stopping by!:wave:
