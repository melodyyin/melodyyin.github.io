##Hi there! My name is Melody. 

![cheeks less chubby than they appear](/etc/itme.jpg)

I graduated from Northwestern University in June with degrees in Statistics and Computer Science. I am an aspiring data scientist! Most recently, I built [a patient tracking system for hospitals](http://melodyyin.github.io/patient-activity-detection-using-kinect). Here is [my about.me page](https://about.me/melodyyin) for more information.

I love reading poetry, listening to podcasts and learning what's new in the technology industry. I also enjoy creating and appreciating art in all forms!

If you want to get in touch, shoot me an email at melodyyin@u.northwestern.edu or find me on [Yelp](http://yayhappyreviews.yelp.com/) or [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Melody-Yin-5). 

Thanks for stopping by! :eyes:
