## Hi there! My name is Melody. 
 
![cheeks less chubby than they appear](/etc/itme.jpg)

I graduated from Northwestern University in June with degrees in Statistics and Computer Science. I am a data scientist based on San Francisco! 

I love playing tennis and chess, reading poetry, listening to podcasts and learning what's new in the technology industry. I also enjoy creating and appreciating art in all forms!
