###This is where I will be keeping a list of the statscapades I have embarked on! 
There are many things I don't know. If I encounter something new and interesting, I will try it, document my experiences and publish them here. All code is shown so you can follow along if the concept is unfamiliar to you too, or you can send me suggestions for improvement/revision (email at the bottom) if you are an expert. I'm very much #teamlearning!
