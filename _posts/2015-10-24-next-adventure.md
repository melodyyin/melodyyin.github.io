I'm excited to announce that starting in November, I will be joining [thredUP](https://www.thredup.com/) as a Data Scientist in San Francisco!

Everyone on the team is bright, motivated and positive - exactly the kind of people I want to work with! Furthermore, thredUP's mission to encourage shoppers to think secondhand first really resonates with me, and I am proud to have the opportunity to contribute to it!

I am also excited to be moving to San Francisco. While I feel happy and energized to be working alongside others who share the same passion I have for technology, I recognize that techies aren't the only residents of the city. To me, that means [keeping an open mind](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/silicon-valley-isnt-a-meritocracy-and-the-cult-of-the-entrepreneur-holds-people-back/) always and knowing that I have more to contribute than the work I do for my company. 

Cheers to new beginnings! :tada:
