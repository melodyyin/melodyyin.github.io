title: Mistakes I've Made in My First 8 Months as a Data Scientist

It's been a little over 8 months since my first day working as a Data Scientist, which is also my first job out of college. It's time to document some lessons that I've realized through experience, and some I had to learn the hard way. 


- Not setting aside time to prepare the delivery of the message

*How I learned this*: By being in meetings where I didn't get the expected reactions from my audience because I had fumbled through the presentation 

The saying that data scientists are storytellers is as true as it is overused. At a small/mid-sized company like thredUP, we are frequently the owner of our projects. It took me a while to realize that I'm not just responsible for the technical parts, but also the communication of my work to non-technical coworkers. In addition to nailing the presentation at the conclusion of the project, I learned that it's also important to prepare your message for the checkpoints to your own team so that they can both learn from you and help you out where needed. 

- Not recognizing that simple is often enough and sometimes better  

*How I learned this*: By missing a deadline because I was making a "fancy" model only to spend more time a few weeks down the line to simplify it, which actually led to more accurate results and a more interpretable methodology.
In summary, the phrase: "Make it work, then make it better" is an accurate reflection of my new attitude towards doing work. 

- Not understanding my manager's role

*How I learned this*: By getting myself into several sticky situations when I've been too self-reliant 

Although it sounds redundant and we all *know* this, I think this is difficult to actually *understand*. I've always known my manager was my boss, but it took me a long time to realize that she's also my facilitator. So, our communication shouldn't solely consist of her giving me direction and me showing her my work, but it should also be me telling her what I'm thinking about and what I need help with. In other words, the manager-managee relationship is actually quite partner-like. I can do my best work when I am most in sync <sub>('Nsync)</sub> with my manager. 

- Not realizing that work != life 

*How I learned this*: By feeling the physical and emotional consequences of spending all of my waking hours either at work or stressing about work

I think this is another truth that seems obvious but is hard to accept and even more difficult to apply in your life, especially while transitioning from being a student, which is something you are 24/7, to a working professional, which *should* only be what you are 8 hours a day on the weekdays. 

I used to justify spending a lot of time at work by telling myself that this is what new grads do - that we need to "pay our dues" in the first few years of joining the job market. However, I realized that even though your output could be higher by staying late and doing work on the weekends, the more time you invest towards work the more your job begins to control you. Your mood sways with how your project is going. And as it happens with anything worth doing, there will be some ups and plenty of downs, so it's best not to tie your sanity to this rollercoaster ride. 

- Not letting myself be a beginner

*How I learned this*: By feeling the consequences of constantly being self-critical 

While it's always good to aim high, I learned that it's also important to realize when the expectations you've placed upon yourself are unrealistic. For example, an entry-level engineer should not compare himself to the CTO and berate him or herself for not performing at the same level - that's just silly. It sounds trite, but it took me a bit to understand that it's ok to make mistakes and to not know things. Ironically, I think that it's only by learning from what appears to be setbacks, can we ever grow out of being beginners.

Although I've only mentioned a few key lessons here, there are plenty more that I've acquired over the past few months. I'm grateful to my company, managers and co-workers for this opportunity to learn and expand. I'm also proud of myself! The transition from school to work is not easy, and it can be even tougher if you're in a new city. If something I've said resonated with you and you want to talk, I want to listen. My email is listed below!

Next post will be summarizing the [compatibility quiz](https://github.com/melodyyin/compatibility_quiz) I made this past weekend.
