##Hi there, welcome to my blag[*](https://xkcd.com/148/)! 
My name is Melody and I recently graduated with my Master's degree in Computer Science following my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Northwestern University. I created this blag to document my statscapades, new learning experiences and fun experiments! 

This blog is hosted by Github and created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The theme I am using was created by [Mark Otto](http://markdotto.com/) and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/#readme). 

A few more acknowledgements:  
- My dear friend Karen, who told me: "the **least** you can do is to have your website redirect to your GitHub page" <sub>(my domain registration expired)</sub>
- [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/), whose [howto entry](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) helped guide me through the setup process
- [MicrowaveSam's video on basic Git commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds)

bbl!
